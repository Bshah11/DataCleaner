## Raid Formation
* **Component ID:** the_argent_flight_raid_formation
* **Component Type:** Faction Ability

### Clarification Notes
1. TheAnti–Fighter Barragestep happens during each space combat, even if no fighters are present in the system.
2. Raid Formationoccurs when hits are produced, not after hits are assigned. As such, cancelling any hits will not prevent an opponent’s ships from becoming damaged.
3. If any of the anti–fighter barrage dice are rerolled, the number of ships that become damaged will depend only on the rerolled values.
4. The Argent player may choose a damaged ship. This will have no effect.
5. The chosen ship becomes damaged, it does not use itsSustain Damageability. As such, effects that trigger when a ship uses itsSustain Damageability, such as theDirect HitorReflective Shieldingaction cards, cannot be played.
6. The chosen ship may be repaired by theDuranium Armortechnology later in the same round of combat.
7. If the Letnev player owns theirNon–Euclidean Shieldingfaction technology, this will not reduce the number of ships that the Argent player chooses.
8. The ships cannot be repaired by the effect of the Empyrean player’s flagship, the Dynamo.
9. If the Argent player plays theWaylayaction card, hits in excess of their opponent’s fighters will first cause chosen ships to become damaged, then those same hits must still be assigned.
10. For example, say the opponent has three fighters and three dreadnoughts, undamaged. The Argent player playsWaylay, and rolls five hits. This allows them to cause two of the dreadnoughts to become damaged. The opponent then has to assign all five hits. The final dreadnought may use itsSustain Damageability to cancel one of those hits.
11. If the Argent player is in combat with the Nekro player, and the Nekro player has their mechs participating in the space combat via the effects ofThe Alastor, those mechs may become damaged by the effect ofRaid Formation.

## Strike Wing Alpha
* **Component ID:** the_argent_flight_strike_wing_alpha
* **Component Type:** Unit

### Clarification Notes
1. When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10 for theiranti–fighter barrageability, infantry are destroyed at the end of theRoll Dicestep. This occurs before any ship may use itsSustain Damageability at the start of theAssign Hitsstep.
2. Effects that cancel hits, such as theShields Holdingaction card, cannot prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effect rerolls any anti–fighter barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.
3. If the last of a player’s ground forces are destroyed by the ability of a Strike Wing Alpha II, and that player meets the other conditions for elimination, that player is immediately eliminated. All of their units are removed from the board, and the Argent player wins the combat.
