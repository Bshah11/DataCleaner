## Hel–Titan
* **Component ID:** the_titans_of_ul_heltitan
* **Component Type:** Unit

### Clarification Notes
1. The Ul player cannot use the secondary ability of theWarfarestrategy card to use theProductionability of a Hel–Titan.
2. When multiple units use theirProductionability, theProductionvalue is pooled. As such, if the Ul player has two Hel–Titans in a system, they may produce two infantry or two fighters for one resource, rather than two resources.
3. Effects that remove ground forces, and then place them on the game board without transporting them, such as theDecoy Operationaction card or theTransit Diodestechnology, may be used on a Hel–Titan.
4. Effects that move ground forces, such as theGhost Squadaction card or the ability of the N’orr player’s commander, G’hom Sek’kus, (via theAlliancepromissory note), cannot be used to move a Hel–Titan to another planet.
5. If a player is able to ignorePlanetary Shield, then Hel–Titan are eligible units to assign any hits produced by a bombardment roll.

### Clarification Notes
1. The trade good may be spent on the units produced by theProductionability that triggered Tungstantus.

3. A trade good will not be gained unless at least one unit is produced.
4. Other effects that produce units without a unit using itsProductionability will not trigger Tungstantus.

## Hecatoncheires
* **Component ID:** the_titans_of_ul_hecatoncheires
* **Component Type:** Mech

### Clarification Notes
1. When the Ul player would place multiple PDS during a single step, they may resolve aDeployability to place one Hecatoncheires for any or all of those PDS.
2. ADeployability may only be resolved for units in a player’s reinforcements. If all four of the Hecatoncheires are already on the board, no Hecatoncheires may be deployed.
3. The Ul player cannot place a PDS on a planet that already has two of their PDS on it. As such, they are unable to place a Hecatoncheires on a planet with two of their PDS using itsDeployability.
4. The Ul player must have at least one PDS in their reinforcements to place in order to use theDeployability of a Hecatoncheires. However, when they would place a PDS, they may remove a PDS from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and put it in their reinforcements. They may then use theDeployability of a Hecatoncheires.
