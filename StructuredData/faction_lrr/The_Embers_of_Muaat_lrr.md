## Magmus
* **Component ID:** the_embers_of_muaat_magmus
* **Component Type:** Commander

### Clarification Notes
1. When a command token is spent to resolve the secondary ability of a strategy card, the trade good is gained after resolving the secondary ability. As such, it cannot be spent to pay for costs of the secondary ability.
2. If the Muaat player spends multiple tokens from their strategy pool (e.g. for theLead From the Frontobjective), they gain that many trade goods, one at a time.
3. Each trade good gained may trigger the Mentak player’sPillagefaction ability.
4. If the Muaat player wishes to scoreLead From the FrontandForm a Spy Networkduring the one status phase, they must do so simultaneously, and both happen before the Mentak player may use theirPillagefaction ability. If the Mentak player subsequently uses their agent, Suffi An, when they use theirPillagefaction ability on the trade goods the Muaat player gained from Magmus when spending the tokens forLead From the Front, then the Muaat player cannot discard the drawn action card forForm a Spy Network.
5. If the Muaat player uses the ability of theScepter of Emelparrelic, they will be unable to benefit from the ability of Magmus.
6. The Muaat player must have Magmus unlocked before spending the strategy token in order to gain the trade good.
7. For example, if the Muaat player spends a strategy token to follow the secondary ability of theWarfarestrategy card, and in doing so produces the war sun that unlocks Magmus, they will not gain the trade good from spending that strategy token.
