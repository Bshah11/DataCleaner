Both players will still use the target player’s full commodity value to determine which units they may capture. Should the first player to resolve capture the last of a type of unit from the target player’s reinforcements, the latter player cannot capture a unit of the same type.
4. If the Yssaril player duplicates the Mentak player’s Suffi An agent, then the Yssaril player and the player targeted by the Mentak player’sPillageability will draw action cards. The Mentak player will not.
