If the Empyrean player moves a ship into a system containing one of the Saar player’s Floating Factories, and no other ships, that Floating Factory will by blockaded and destroyed before the Empyrean player can unlock Xuange.

11. If an action card is played that will have an effect later, such as a rider, that card may only be cancelled by a Watcher when it is originally played.
12. If the action card that was cancelled by a Watcher was to be used to perform a component action, the active player must perform a different action, or pass.

However, if the Empyrean player has units or controls a planet in one of the systems, they will be neighbors with any player with units or controlling a planet in the other, and vice versa.
5. A player with ships in one of the systems cannot use those ships to place a command token in, and then move their ships into, the other system with theSkilled Retreataction card.
