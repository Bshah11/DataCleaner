## Quantum Entanglement

* **Component Type:** Faction Ability

### Clarification Notes
1. The effect of theEnforced Travel Banlaw does not affect the Creuss player.
2. If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and that player are neighbors.
3. The Mentak player may use theirPillageability against the Creuss player in this manner.
4. If Mecatol Rex contains an alpha wormhole, then the “For” effect of theIxthian Artifactagenda will not affect the Creuss player’s units in a system with a beta wormhole (and no alpha wormhole), and vice versa.
5. The Creuss player’sQuantum Entanglementability applies to their units with theDeep Space Cannonability. Other players cannot useQuantum Entanglementto produce hits from a unit with theDeep Space Cannonability against the Creuss player’s units.

## Wormhole Generator
* **Component ID:** the_ghosts_of_creuss_wormhole_generator
* **Component Type:** Technology
* **Revision ID:** the_ghosts_of_creuss_wormhole_generator_1
* **Source:** Codex
* **Revision Number:** 1
* **Status:** Current

### Clarification Notes
1. The Creuss player may move a wormhole token from the system it is in into the same system.
2. Wormhole Generatorcannot place wormhole tokens in the home system of an eliminated player.

---

## Hil Colish
* **Component ID:** the_ghosts_of_creuss_hil_colish
* **Component Type:** Flagship

### Clarification Notes
1. If theHil Colishmoves first, then the Creuss player uses the new position of theHil Colishwhen determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.
2. If theHil Colishmoves last, then it may move itself into (or through, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player’s other ships may move through the wormhole created by theHil Colish.
3. The delta wormhole moves with theHil Colish; it cannot move back to its origin system using its own delta wormhole.
4. The Creuss player must declare all ships that will moving before they move theHil Colishor their other ships. They then declare the path that the first ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ship(s). They then declare the path that the other ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ships. Any ships that were declared to move must, if it is possible to do so.
5. If theHil Colishis moved first, and is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, other ships that were declared to move that can reach the destination system must do so, even if the path is through the gravity rift. Ships that cannot reach the active system do not move.
6. The Creuss player cannot wait to see the result of their other ships’ gravity rift rolls before deciding to move theHil Colish; they must declare if theHil Colishis moving at the same time they declare which other ships are moving.
7. If theHil Colishmoves before or after other ships, it does not generate a secondSpace Cannon Offensestep.
8. A unit with theDeep Space Cannonability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in theHil Colish’s system. Most commonly, this will allow the Creuss player to target units in theHil Colish’s system from the space cannon rolls of units in their home system.
9. If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player’s ships (such as theLight/Wave Deflectortechnology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in theHil Colish’s system.
10. During space combat involving theHil Colish, either player may retreat to another system containing a delta wormhole, if that system meets the other requirements for retreating.
11. If theHil Colishis destroyed between theAnnounce Retreatsstep and theRetreatstep, then the retreating player must retreat to a different eligible system. If no such system exists, then their retreat is cancelled.
12. When theHil Colishretreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss player’s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent the other ships from retreating to the same system.

## Emissary Taivra
* **Component ID:** the_ghosts_of_creuss_emissary_taivra
* **Component Type:** Agent

### Clarification Notes
1. The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.
2. A delta wormhole in the system (such as from theHil Colish) does not prevent this ability from being usable.
3. If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.
4. If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.
5. The system must have a non–delta wormhole in it at the moment of activation. If a wormhole is placed in a system with no other wormholes using the ability of an Icarus Drive, then Emissary Taivra cannot be used during the same activation.
6. If a wormhole is placed at the start of a player’s turn in the system using the Creuss IFF, then Emissary Taivra may be used for the activation immediately following.

## Sai Seravus
* **Component ID:** the_ghosts_of_creuss_sai_seravus
* **Component Type:** Commander

### Clarification Notes
1. The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity of the system is reached.
2. The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.
3. The Creuss cannot place additional fighters once they have fighters and infantry in the space area equal to their capacity in that system, even if they have unused fleet pool and the fighter II unit upgrade technology.
4. If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in order to continue placing fighters.
5. This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player’s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.
6. If the Creuss player retreats from a combat, then they will have no capacity in the active system, and so cannot place any fighters there.
7. If the Mahact player uses theirBenedictionhero ability to move the Creuss player’s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.
8. A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.
9. When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole, ending in a system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.
10. If the Creuss player moves theHil Colishseparately from other ships during the sameMove Shipsstep, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement is completed.

### Clarification Notes
1. Each wormhole in the system provides theProductionvalue and discount, even those of the same type.
2. If the Creuss player moves theHil Colishinto a system, the Creuss player may use theProductionability of the associated delta wormhole during the production step of the same tactical action.
