* **Component ID:** the_federation_of_sol_claire_gibson
* **Component Type:** Commander

### Clarification Notes
1. If an invasion involves ground combat on multiple planets, an infantry will be placed on each.
2. If the Sol player has no ground forces on a planet they control, ground combat will not occur, and so they cannot place an infantry on that planet. This includes if they lose the last of their ground forces during theBombardmentstep of the invasion.
3. The start of ground combat occurs after theSpace Cannon Defensestep. If all of the ground forces committed to a planet are destroyed in that step, then the ground combat will be skipped on that planet, and this ability will not trigger.

## Bellum Gloriosum
* **Component ID:** the_federation_of_sol_bellum_gloriosum
* **Component Type:** Breakthrough

### Clarification Notes
1. If the Sol player produces multiple ships simultaneously, the combined capacity is used to determine how many fighters and ground forces do not count towards theProductionlimit.
2. The additional fighters and ground forces are produced simultaneously with any other fighters and ground forces, and the resources paid will be determined by their combined cost.
3. For example, say that the Sol player hasProduction 2, and wishes to produce a dreadnought and two infantry. They would pay five resources for this, as they would pay a single resource for the pair of infantry.
