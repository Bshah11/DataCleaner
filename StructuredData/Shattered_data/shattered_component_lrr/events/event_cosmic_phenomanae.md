1. Only ships moving out of gravity rifts may apply the +2 to their move value; ships moving through cannot.
2. For ships moving out of a gravity rift, the active player chooses for each one whether it applies +1 or +2 to its move value, and then rolls for removing with the corresponding threshold.
3. Ships that move out of a gravity rift outside of the movement step of a tactical action, such as through retreating from a space combat, must still roll for removal. Their owner may choose which threshold to use.
