3. A player may retreat from a system containing an alpha wormhole into a system containing a beta wormhole, and vice versa, during this action.
4. If a player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and another player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, then those two players are neighbors during this action.
5. A player moving a ship between two systems, both with alpha wormholes or both with beta wormholes, does not have to move through the wormhole, as the systems are adjacent. In particular, if one of those systems has the Ion Storm token, that player chooses if the Ion Storm token will flip.
