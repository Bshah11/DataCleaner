1. A planet may be exhausted to spend its influence or resources, but not both.
2. If a player is to gain multiple planets in a system, they choose the order in which they gain them, and explore each planet as they gain it before gaining the next. As such, a player cannot place ground forces produced byFreelancerson a planet in the active system that they are yet to gain and explore.
3. If a player wishes to place a unit, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.
