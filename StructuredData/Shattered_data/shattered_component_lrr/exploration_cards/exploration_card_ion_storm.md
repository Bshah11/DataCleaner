1. The active player chooses which side of the Ion Storm token is initially face up.
2. All ship movement is simultaneous. If the Ion Storm token system is the active system, and the token is currently on the alpha side, a player cannot move a ship from a system with an alpha wormhole, flip the token, then move a ship from a system with the beta wormhole (then flip the token again).
3. If the Ion Storm token is in a system containing a wormhole of the same type, a player chooses which wormhole they use when moving through a wormhole of that type. The Ion Storm token only flips if it was the chosen wormhole.
4. If ships are moved through the Ion Storm token wormhole outside of theMove ShiporRetreatsubsteps of a tactical action, such as by the effect of theSkilled Retreataction card, the Ion Storm token is not flipped.
