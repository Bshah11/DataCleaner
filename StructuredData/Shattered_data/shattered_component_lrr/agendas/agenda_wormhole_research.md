1. A player with ships in a delta or gamma wormhole may research a technology from the “For” effect. Those ships will not be destroyed.
2. A player must still meet the prerequisites for the technology they research.
3. Ground forces in the space area of a system containing an alpha or beta wormhole will be removed due to lack of capacity after the ships in that system are destroyed; those ground forces will not trigger any “destroyed” effects. Fighters will be destroyed, and will trigger any “destroyed” effects.
4. IfAnti–Intellectual Revolutionis in play as a law, players who research a technology will destroy a ship due toAnti–Intellectual Revolutionbefore they destroy ships in systems containing alpha or beta wormholes. As such, they may choose a ship in a system containing an alpha or beta wormhole to destroy forAnti–Intellectual Revolution
