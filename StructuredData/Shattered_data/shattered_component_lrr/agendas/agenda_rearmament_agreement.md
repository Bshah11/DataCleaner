1. A player that controls no planets in their home system will not place a mech if the “For” outcome of Rearmament Agreement is resolved.
2. If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none in their reinforcements, they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.
3. A player that has no mechs on the game board is unaffected by the “Against” effect of Rearmament Agreement.
