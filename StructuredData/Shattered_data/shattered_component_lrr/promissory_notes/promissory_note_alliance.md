1. AnAlliancemust be played by the receiving player as soon as it is received. It cannot be kept secret.
2. Allianceis returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the other player this turn.
3. If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the other player’s units (for example, the primary ability of theDiplomacystrategy card), this will not causeAllianceto be returned.
4. Activating a system containing only a player’s structures will still cause theirAllianceto be returned.
5. For notes about a commander of a specific faction, see that faction’s notes page.
