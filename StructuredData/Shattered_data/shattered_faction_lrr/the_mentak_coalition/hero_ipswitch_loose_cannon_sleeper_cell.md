#### ID: the_mentak_coalition_ipswitch_loose_cannon_sleeper_cell

1. The Mentak player can trigger theSleeper Cellability, theirAmbushability, or any other “at the start of a space combat” abilities they have in any order.
2. If ships are destroyed before theSleeper Cellability is triggered, the Mentak player cannot place those units.
3. Fleet pool limits still apply during combat. However, if the Mentak player is at their fleet pool limit, they may still place a unit using this ability, but must then immediately remove a unit.
4. Capacity is not checked during combat. As such, the Mentak player may place an unlimited number of fighters into a combat with this ability.
5. If all of the Mentak player’s ships are destroyed, they may still place ships with this ability. If they do, combat will continue.
6. No costs are paid for the placed units.
7. Both players will choose and destroy one of their own ships in the active system for each hit their opponent produced during each round of combat, before the Mentak player places their ships for theSleeper Cellability. As such, the Mentak player may place a ship that was destroyed in the same round of combat, if they destroyed one of their opponent’s ships of the same type, even if they had none of that ship type in their reinforcements.
8. When players would use their ships’Sustain Damageabilities, they do so in alternating order, starting with the attacker. If the Mentak player uses aDirect Hitaction card to destroy one of their opponent’s ships, they must then make the choice immediately if they will replace it using theSleeper Cellability, before any other ships may use theirSustain Damageability. Should the Mentak version of the newly placed ship type have aSustain Damageability, it may then use it during the same combat round.
9. If the Mentak player wishes to place a unit with this ability, but there are none of that type left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit of that type from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. This unit will be placed undamaged.
10. If the opponent has a faction specific ship, including their flagship, destroyed, the Mentak player may place a generic ship of the same type, or theirFourth Moon, as appropriate.
11. If theFourth Moonis destroyed during combat, but the Mentak player then destroys their opponent’s flagship and places theFourth Moonback into the combat, they cannot score theUnveil Flagshipobjective.
12. If the Mentak player starts the combat without theFourth Moon, and places it during the combat, they may score theUnveil Flagshipobjective if theFourth Moonis not destroyed.
13. If a destroyed unit is a ground force or structure, that the other player is treating as a ship due to some effect, the Mentak player cannot place that unit.
14. The Mentak player cannot place a war sun unless they have their war sun technology.
15. The opponent may still retreat during combat.
