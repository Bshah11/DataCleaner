1. While the agenda phase and the Hacan player’sTrade Convoyspromissory note allow a player to resolve transactions with all other players, they do not make that player neighbors with the Mentak player.
2. Effects that force players to give objects to other players are not transactions.
3. If Alice plays Bob’sTrade Agreementpromissory note, then the Mentak player may usePillageon Alice, but not Bob.
4. If the Creuss player has units or controls planets in a system with an alpha wormhole, and the Mentak player has units or controls planets in a system with a beta wormhole, or vice versa, then the Creuss player and Mentak player are neighbors. The Mentak player may thus use theirPillageability against the Creuss player.
5. If the Winnu player ownsLazax Gate Folding, then the Mentak player may become neighbors with the Winnu player during the Winnu player’s tactical action. If so, the Mentak player may use theirPillageability during this time.
6. If a player would gain multiple trade goods one at a time, the Mentak player can use theirPillageability for each trade good.
7. If a game effect instructs a player to convert their commodities to trade goods, that player does not gain any trade goods from that effect. The Mentak player cannot use theirPillageability for those trade goods.
8. The Mentak player may use theirPillageability even if the transaction does not involve trade goods.
9. The Mentak player may use theirPillageability against both players involved in a transaction.
10. If the Mentak player resolves a transaction with another player, they may then use theirPillageability against that player.
11. The Mentak player does not decide to use theirPillageability until after the transaction has been resolved. Any deal made to not use theirPillageability before the transaction has been resolved is non–binding.
