1. The action card that the Ral Nel player gives to another player must be one of the two that they drew, and not another action card from their hand.
2. If the Yssaril player duplicates the effect of Kan Kip Rel with Ssruu, their agent, they will triggerScheming. They will draw three action cards, and give one of those three to another player. They will then add the remaining two to their hand, and then discard any action card from their hand.
