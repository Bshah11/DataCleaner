1. Non–Euclidean Shieldingmay be applied when a Dunlain Reaper uses itsSustain damageability.
2. Non–Euclidean Shieldingapplies whenever hits are produced. This includes hits produced byBombardmentandSpace Cannonabilities.
3. If there are multiple hits that can be cancelled, then the Letnev player must cancel two hits whenever one of their units uses itsSustain damageability; they cannot cancel just one.
4. Say the Letnev player has exactly one hit produced against them remaining, and one of their units uses itsSustain damageability to cancel it. If additional hits are produced against the Letnev player's units, such as with theReflective Shieldingaction card, the Letnev player cannot retroactively use the previous use ofSustain damageto allowNon–Euclidean Shieldingto cancel a second hit.
