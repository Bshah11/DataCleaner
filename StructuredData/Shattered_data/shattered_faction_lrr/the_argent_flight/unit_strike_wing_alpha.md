1. When a Strike Wing Alpha II rolls a 9 or 10 for theiranti–fighter barrageability, infantry are destroyed at the end of theRoll Dicestep. This occurs before any ship may use itsSustain Damageability at the start of theAssign Hitsstep.
2. Effects that cancel hits, such as theShields Holdingaction card, cannot prevent the infantry from being destroyed. If an effect rerolls any anti–fighter barrage dice, the new result will determine how many infantry are destroyed.
