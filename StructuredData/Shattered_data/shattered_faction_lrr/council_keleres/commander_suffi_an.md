1. The trade good to unlock Suffi An is spent after, and independent of, any trade goods spent while resolving the action card.
2. If the Keleres player uses their additional action to perform another component action, they may perform another additional action. They may do this any number of times.
3. Suffi An does not trigger from the component action of the action card used that was to unlock her.
4. If the Keleres player can perform a second action through some other game effect (such as theFleet Logisticstechnology), they may unlock Suffi An by playing an action card with a component action for their first action, then perform a second component action, which will then allow them to perform a third action because of Suffi An.
5. If a player’s turn is ended by a game effect, they cannot use Suffi An to perform an additional action.
6. A player cannot use Suffi An to pass on the same turn they performed an action.
7. If a player’s additional action would be to use a component action to play an action card, and that card is cancelled, they are not required to perform an alternate additional action on that turn.
