1. The Keleres player chooses their starting technology after all other players, including the Argent, Bastion, Deepwrought, Firmament, Ral Nel, Rebellion, and Winnu players, have gained their starting technologies.
2. If there are not two unique starting technologies amongst those owned by other players, the Keleres player will start the game with fewer technologies. This will most commonly happen in a three player game, where one of the other players is playing as N’orr or Winnu.
