1. Planets in the home system of an eliminated player will not contribute to unlocking G’hom Sek’kus.
2. This ability allows the N’orr player to commit ground forces to a planet even if they have no ships in the active system.
3. TheParleyaction card will place the committed ground forces in the space area of the active system. If the N’orr player does not have enough capacity in the space area for the extra ground forces, including zero capacity, they will have to remove fighters and ground forces to meet capacity limits.
4. The N’orr player may commit up to one ground force from each eligible planet during eachInvasionstep, regardless of the number of planets they are committing ground forces to.
5. The N’orr player may only commit ground forces as the active player.
6. Only the active player may use theBombardmentability of their units during an invasion. As such, any ships in the active system will be unable to use theirBombardmentability unless they belong to the N’orr player.
7. This prevents the L1Z1X player from using theirHarrowfaction ability, unless they have the N’orrAlliancepromissory note and they are the active player.
8. Another player may still produce hits against the N’orr player’s ground forces committed using G’hom Sek’kus during theSpace Cannon Defensestep.
9. The N’orr player must legally be able to move into the destination system in order to commit ground forces with G’hom Sek’kus
10. If another player plays the N’orr player’sCeasefirepromissory note, they cannot commit any ground forces to planets in the active system during this action, other than ground forces already in the active system.
11. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in an asteroid field, unless the N’orr player owns theAntimass Deflectorstechnology.
12. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces to Mirage if it is in a supernova. Another player may do so if they own theMagmus ReactorMuaat faction technology and the N’orr player’s Alliance promissory note.
13. If the N’orr player commits any ground forces from a gravity rift system, those ground forces must roll for removal.
14. The N’orr player cannot commit ground forces through a wormhole if theEnforced Travel Banlaw is in play.
15. The N’orr player may use this ability to commit ground forces to any planet in the active system, regardless of who, if anyone, controls it.
16. If the N’orr player purges theDominus Orbrelic during theMovementstep of a tactical action, they may use G’hom Sek’kus to commit ground forces from systems that contain their command tokens during that tactical action.
17. TheCommit Ground Forcesstep is entirely resolved before theEstablish Controlstep (with other steps between). When the N’orr player gains control of their fifth non–home system planet, an unlocks G’hom Sek’kus, they cannot then use G’hom Sek’kus to commit additional ground forces during that tactical action.
18. Ground forces cannot be committed to a planet if it has theDemilitarized Zoneexploration card attached.
