1. Placing the structure will occur after theProductionstep. If the Winnu player places a Space Dock, they cannot produce out of it during the same action.
2. If the Winnu player has no PDS or Space Docks left in their reinforcements, they may remove a unit from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that unit on the newly controlled planet.
3. If the Winnu player gains control of a planet with multiple Reclaimers, they may place a structure for each one, if they may do so without exceeding the maximum number of that structure allowed on a planet.
4. The Reclaimer need only be on the planet at the end of the tactical action the Winnu player gained it, not when the Winnu player gains control of it. This can occur from effects such as theInfiltrateaction card, or some exploration cards.
