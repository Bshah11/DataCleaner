1. E–Res Siphonsability is triggered when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Jol–Nar player this turn.
2. If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Jol–Nar player’s ships (for example, the primary ability of theDiplomacystrategy card), this will not causeE–Res Siphonsability to trigger.
