#### ID: the_titans_of_ul_hecatoncheires

1. When the Ul player would place multiple PDS during a single step, they may resolve aDeployability to place one Hecatoncheires for any or all of those PDS.
2. ADeployability may only be resolved for units in a player’s reinforcements. If all four of the Hecatoncheires are already on the board, no Hecatoncheires may be deployed.
3. The Ul player cannot place a PDS on a planet that already has two of their PDS on it. As such, they are unable to place a Hecatoncheires on a planet with two of their PDS using itsDeployability.
4. The Ul player must have at least one PDS in their reinforcements to place in order to use theDeployability of a Hecatoncheires. However, when they would place a PDS, they may remove a PDS from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and put it in their reinforcements. They may then use theDeployability of a Hecatoncheires.
