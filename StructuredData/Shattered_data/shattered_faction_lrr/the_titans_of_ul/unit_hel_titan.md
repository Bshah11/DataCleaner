1. The Ul player cannot use the secondary ability of theWarfarestrategy card to use theProductionability of a Hel–Titan.

3. Effects that remove ground forces, and then place them on the game board without transporting them, such as theDecoy Operationaction card or theTransit Diodestechnology, may be used on a Hel–Titan.
4. Effects that move ground forces, such as theGhost Squadaction card or the ability of the N’orr player’s commander, G’hom Sek’kus, (via theAlliancepromissory note), cannot be used to move a Hel–Titan to another planet.
5. If a player is able to ignorePlanetary Shield, then Hel–Titan are eligible units to assign any hits produced by a bombardment roll.
