# LRR CLARIFICATION: The Ghosts of Creuss
## TYPE: Agent
### COMPONENT: Emissary Taivra
#### ID: the_ghosts_of_creuss_emissary_taivra

1. The Creuss player may use this ability to access the inactive wormhole nexus without a gamma wormhole. Moving ships into the wormhole nexus this way will cause it to flip.
2. A delta wormhole in the system (such as from theHil Colish) does not prevent this ability from being usable.
3. If this ability is used, the active system will be adjacent to systems with delta wormholes.
4. If a ship moves from the system containing the Ion Storm, it will not flip, unless the active player may move ships through the Ion Storm wormhole and chooses to do so.
5. The system must have a non–delta wormhole in it at the moment of activation. If a wormhole is placed in a system with no other wormholes using the ability of an Icarus Drive, then Emissary Taivra cannot be used during the same activation.
6. If a wormhole is placed at the start of a player’s turn in the system using the Creuss IFF, then Emissary Taivra may be used for the activation immediately following.
