# LRR CLARIFICATION: The Ghosts of Creuss
## TYPE: Flagship
### COMPONENT: Hil Colish
#### ID: the_ghosts_of_creuss_hil_colish

1. If theHil Colishmoves first, then the Creuss player uses the new position of theHil Colishwhen determining if the active system may be reached by their other ships.
2. If theHil Colishmoves last, then it may move itself into (or through, if its move value is increased) the Creuss Gate or Creuss home system. Before it does so, the Creuss player’s other ships may move through the wormhole created by theHil Colish.
3. The delta wormhole moves with theHil Colish; it cannot move back to its origin system using its own delta wormhole.
4. The Creuss player must declare all ships that will moving before they move theHil Colishor their other ships. They then declare the path that the first ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ship(s). They then declare the path that the other ship(s) to move will travel along, and move those ships. Any ships that were declared to move must, if it is possible to do so.
5. If theHil Colishis moved first, and is removed due to the effect of a gravity rift, other ships that were declared to move that can reach the destination system must do so, even if the path is through the gravity rift. Ships that cannot reach the active system do not move.
6. The Creuss player cannot wait to see the result of their other ships’ gravity rift rolls before deciding to move theHil Colish; they must declare if theHil Colishis moving at the same time they declare which other ships are moving.
7. If theHil Colishmoves before or after other ships, it does not generate a secondSpace Cannon Offensestep.
8. A unit with theDeep Space Cannonability may produce hits in systems adjacent to that unit via the delta wormhole in theHil Colish’s system. Most commonly, this will allow the Creuss player to target units in theHil Colish’s system from the space cannon rolls of units in their home system.
9. If an effect allows another player to move through a system that contains the Creuss player’s ships (such as theLight/Wave Deflectortechnology), that player may move through the delta wormhole in theHil Colish’s system.
10. During space combat involving theHil Colish, either player may retreat to another system containing a delta wormhole, if that system meets the other requirements for retreating.
11. If theHil Colishis destroyed between theAnnounce Retreatsstep and theRetreatstep, then the retreating player must retreat to a different eligible system. If no such system exists, then their retreat is cancelled.
12. When theHil Colishretreats, it may retreat before or after the Creuss player’s other ships, but cannot retreat in such a way that would prevent the other ships from retreating to the same system.
