1. The fighters are placed one at a time, until either one has been placed for each ship with capacity that moved through a wormhole, or the capacity of the system is reached.
2. The Creuss player cannot remove a ground force to create capacity for a fighter.
3. The Creuss cannot place additional fighters once they have fighters and infantry in the space area equal to their capacity in that system, even if they have unused fleet pool and the fighter II unit upgrade technology.
4. If the Creuss player has a space dock in the active system, they may consider some of the fighters they place as held by the space dock, in order to continue placing fighters.
5. This ability may be used whenever the Creuss player’s ships move, not just during the movement step of a tactical action.
6. If the Creuss player retreats from a combat, then they will have no capacity in the active system, and so cannot place any fighters there.
7. If the Mahact player uses theirBenedictionhero ability to move the Creuss player’s ships, then the Creuss player may use this ability.
8. A ship may move out of a system and back into the same system during tactical action movement, if its move value is high enough. If the Creuss player does this with a ship with capacity, and moves in this manner via a wormhole, they may place a fighter, if possible.
9. When the Creuss player moves a ship through a wormhole, ending in a system that contains an alpha or beta wormhole and unlocks Sai Seravus, they cannot apply its ability to that movement.
10. If the Creuss player moves theHil Colishseparately from other ships during the sameMove Shipsstep, Sai Seravus cannot unlock until all movement is completed.
