1. Any effect that may target ships or non–fighter ships may target a ground force that is participating in space combat due to the effect ofThe Alastor.
2. This includes counting towards the three non–fighter ships necessary to trigger the effect of theAssault Cannontechnology.
3. The Winnu player’s flagship, theSalai Sai Corian, will roll one dice for each ground force the Nekro player has participating in a space combat via the effect ofThe Alastor.
4. After the Nekro player uses the ability ofThe Alastor, all other players will have the opportunity to resolve an “at the start of combat” or an “at the start of a round of combat” ability before the Nekro player may resolve another ability.
5. For example, say the Nekro player owns theAssault Cannontechnology, and uses the ability ofThe Alastorto bring the total number of non–fighter ships in the combat to three (or more). Other players may then resolve one ability each. If their opponent uses an ability that destroys ships, such as from their ownAssault Cannon, to reduce the number of non–fighter ships the Nekro player has in the combat to two (or fewer), then the Nekro player will be unable to resolve the ability of theirAssault Cannon
6. Some abilities may destroyThe Alastorat the start of a combat before the Nekro player has used its ability, such as theAssault Cannontechnology.
7. Ground forces on planets remain there while participating in combat. Effects that target units in a space area cannot target these ground forces.
8. When the Nekro player is in a space combat against the Argent player, their infantry on planets participating in the combat cannot be targeted by the ability of the Argent player’sStrike Wing Alpha IIdestroyers.
9. IfThe Alastoris destroyed during space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat.
10. If the Nekro player copies another player’s flagship unit upgrade technology with one of theirValefar Assimilatortechnologies during a space combat, any ground forces in that combat remain in that combat. If the Nekro player starts the space combat copying another player’s flagship unit upgrade technology, ground forces cannot participate in that combat, unless the Nekro player stops copying that flagship unit upgrade technology during the “start of combat” window.
11. The ground forces in the space area during the combat still retain their ability to be transported. Since transported units do not count against capacity during combat, these ground forces will not count toward the Nekro player’s fleet pool limit.
12. A mech in the space combat may be targeted with theDirect Hitaction card if it uses itsSustain Damageability.
13. If the Nekro player has one of theirValefar Assimilatortokens on the Ul player’s Hel Titan II faction unit upgrade technology, they may useThe Alastorto have their PDS in the active system participate in the space combat.
14. A ground force participating in a space combat may count towards scoring theDemonstrate Your Powersecret objective.
15. If the Nekro player loses their last ground force during a space combat and consequently meets the requirements for elimination, they are immediately eliminated. They will not be given the opportunity to score any objectives from winning the combat or destroying certain units at the same time their last ground force was destroyed.
16. If the Nekro player uses aDirect Hitaction card to destroy an opponent’s flagship, they may score theDestroy their Greatest Shipsecret objective, even if there are some hits remaining that will cause the Nekro player to be eliminated once they are assigned. If this would bring the Nekro player to ten victory points, they will instead win the game before they are eliminated.
