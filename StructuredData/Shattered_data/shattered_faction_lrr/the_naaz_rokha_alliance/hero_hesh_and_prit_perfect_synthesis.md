2. The Naaz–Rokha player cannot choose the same strategy card twice.
3. The Naaz–Rokha player must choose which strategy cards they will perform the secondary abilities of before they resolve any of those abilities.
4. When resolving the abilities of two strategy cards, they may be resolved in either order. Game objects affected by the first strategy card ability may be affected by the second.
5. For example, say the Naaz–Rokha player chooses to resolve the secondary abilities of theDiplomacyandWarfarestrategy cards. They may resolve theDiplomacyability first to ready some planets, then exhaust those same planets to pay for the units they produce with theWarfareability. Alternatively, they may resolve theWarfareability first, exhausting some of their readied planets to pay for the units they produce, then resolve theDiplomacyability to ready those same planets.
6. If a player is eliminated, the strategy cards that they had are considered “unchosen”.
