1. The Naaz–Rokha mechs are only Z–Grav Eidolon during theSpace Combatstep, only in the active system, and only in the space area.
2. If the Naaz–Rokha player had  an Eidolon in the space area of the active system, they must mandatorily use its ability to convert it to a Z–Grav Eidolon.
3. All other players will have the opportunity to resolve an ability between the Naaz–Rokha player resolving their Eidolon ability and any other ability.
4. If the Naaz–Rokha player owns theAssault Cannontechnology, they may count their Z–Grav Eidolon towards the three non–fighter ships, once they resolve its ability. However, if another player then resolves an ability that reduces the number of non–ships the Naaz–Rokha player has in the active system to less than three, the Naaz–Rokha player will no longer be able to resolve theAssault Cannontechnology ability.
5. Any effect that may target ships or non–fighter ships may target a Z–Grav Eidolon.
6. A Z–Grav Eidolon is still a ground force and a mech.
7. A Z–Grav Eidolon participating in a space combat may count towards scoring theDemonstrate Your Powersecret objective.
8. When a Z–Grav Eidolon reverts back to an Eidolon at the end of combat, it will count towards capacity in the active system. Capacity limits must be met before proceeding to theInvasionstep.
