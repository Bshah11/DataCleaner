1. During theSpace Cannon Offensesupstep of a tactical action, the active player resolves theSpace Cannonabilities of their units first. If the Xxcha player is not the active player, and their ships are removed by another player’s space cannon roll, they must immediately remove units to meet their capacity limit. They will not resolve theSpace Cannonabilities of any of their removed mechs.
2. During theSpace Cannon Defensesubstep of a tactical action, only non–active players can use theSpace Cannonability of their units. The Xxcha player cannot use theSpace Cannonability of their mechs immediately after committing them to a planet against units owned by that planet’s controller.
