1. A player cannot have more commodities than their commodity value.
2. If the Empyrean player plays a player’sTrade Agreementpromissory note, this will count for that player giving the Empyrean player all their commodities.
3. The trade goods gained fromDark Pactare gained simultaneously with the commodities transacted between the two players. As a pair of players is limited to one transaction per turn (which must involve the active player) or per agenda, the two players cannot then perform a transaction for these trade goods on the same turn.
4. As the trade goods fromDark Pactare gained simultaneously with any commodities and/or trade goods transacted, the Mentak player may only use theirPillageability on each player once perDark Pacttransaction.
5. Dark Pacthas no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
6. Dark Pactis returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.
7. Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player’s structures will still causeDark Pactto be returned.
8. If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player’s units (for example, the primary ability of theDiplomacystrategy card), this will not causeDark Pactto be returned.
