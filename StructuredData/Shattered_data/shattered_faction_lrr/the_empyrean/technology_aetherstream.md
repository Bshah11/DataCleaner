1. The Empyrean player does not decide to use this ability until after the other player has activated a system. Any deal made to use this ability before the system has been activated is non–binding.
2. A system is not adjacent to itself. If a system with an anomaly is activated,Aetherstreamwill not give any ships +1 to their move value, unless that system is adjacent to another anomaly.
