### COMPONENT: Dynamo
#### ID: the_empyrean_dynamo

1. A unit may only use itsSustain Damageability once in eachAssign Hitsstep, even if it is repaired.
2. A unit that becomes damaged without using itsSustain Damageability will not trigger this effect.
3. A player may play aDirect Hitaction card during the same timing window as this ability. If they do so, the ship is destroyed.
4. Each unit using itsSustain Damageability creates a separate timing window. As such, any excess influence used to repair a ship is wasted, and cannot be used to repair a different ship.
5. As an example, The Dark may be exhausted to repair only one ship, not two.
