2. If either player cannot vote on an agenda, then the additional votes will not trigger for that agenda.
3. Blood Pacthas no effect while it is in a player’s hand.
4. Blood Pactis returned when the system is activated, even if the active player will perform no hostile acts towards the Empyrean player this turn.
5. Activating a system containing only the Empyrean player’s structures will still causeBlood Pactto be returned.
6. If an effect other than activating a system during a tactical action places a command counter in a system with the Empyrean player’s units (for example, the primary ability of theDiplomacystrategy card), this will not causeBlood Pactto be returned.
