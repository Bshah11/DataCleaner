1. If the Mahact player is ever required to remove one of their command tokens from their fleet pool, and they only have other players’ command tokens in their fleet pool, they must remove one of those tokens, and return it to the reinforcements of the player that owns it.
2. If the Mahact player is ever limited by the number of tokens they may have in their fleet pool, such as by theFleet Regulationslaw, they may still add a command token to their fleet pool when they are at the limit, but must then remove one command token and return it to the corresponding reinforcements.
3. If the Mahact player wins a combat against a player that has no command tokens in their reinforcements, and none of their command tokens are on the Mahact player’s command sheet, that player must choose one of their command tokens on their command sheet to remove and place on the Mahact player’s command sheet.
4. If a player has no command tokens in their reinforcements or on their command sheet, the Mahact player cannot place one of that player’s command tokens on their command sheet if they win a combat against that player.
5. If the Mahact player is required to place a command token from their reinforcements on the board, such as when they retreat from a space combat, or the primary ability of theDiplomacystrategy card, if they have no tokens in their reinforcements, they must use a Mahact token from any pool of their command sheet, and not another player’s token in their fleet pool.
6. When the Mahact player wins a space combat, they add the command token to their fleet pool before they resolve fleet pool requirements.
7. If the Mahact player wins a combat against the Mentak player and gains one of their command tokens, they cannot resolve the ability of S’ula Mentarion, the Mentak commander, from winning that same combat to take a promissory note from the Mentak player.
