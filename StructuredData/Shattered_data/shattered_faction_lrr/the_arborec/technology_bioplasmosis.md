1. Any number of infantry may move, but all movement is done simultaneously, and no infantry may move beyond an adjacent system. For example, consider a series of systems A–B–C. Only systems connected by a “–” are adjacent. In this case:
2. An infantry cannot move from A to B, then B to C.
3. An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to C.
4. An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from C to B.
5. An infantry may move from B to A, while another infantry moves from B to C.
6. An infantry may move from A to B, while another infantry moves from B to A. This will have no meaningful effect.
7. Bioplasmosiscannot move Letani Behemoth.
