1. The Arborec player cannot use the secondary ability of theWarfarestrategy card to use theProductionability of a Letani Warrior.
2. When multiple units use theirProductionability, theProductionvalue is pooled. As such, if the Arborec player has two Letani Warrior I in a system, they may produce two infantry for one resource, rather than two.
3. If Letani Warriors are on different planets, any produced ground forces may be split between those planets, regardless of the production value of the Letani Warriors on that planet.
