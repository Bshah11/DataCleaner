1. Breaches are not wormholes.
2. A system may have any number of breaches in it.
3. If a player has a ship in a system containing multiple breaches at the end of the status phase, they may remove any or all of them.
4. If the Rebellion player has no more breach tokens in their reinforcements, and an ability instructs them to place a breach, they may remove an inactive breach from the game board and place that.
5. Active breaches cannot be removed in this manner. If every breach token is on the game board as an active breach, the Rebellion player cannot resolve abilities that would place additional breach tokens.
