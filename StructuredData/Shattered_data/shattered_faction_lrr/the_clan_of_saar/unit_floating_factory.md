# LRR CLARIFICATION: The Clan of Saar
## TYPE: Unit
### COMPONENT: Floating Factory
#### ID: the_clan_of_saar_floating_factory

1. A floating Factory does not count towards the Saar player’s fleet pool.
2. When a Floating Factory produces ground forces, they may be placed in the space area or on a planet they control in that system.
3. Hits produced by space cannon rolls cannot be assigned to a Floating Factory.
4. Game effects that affect ship movement, such as theGravity Drivetechnology, theFlank Speedaction card, theLight/Wave Deflectortechnology, theAntimass Deflectorstechnology, etc, may affect Floating Factories.
5. A Floating Factory moving through or out of a gravity rift must roll for removal. It will receive the +1 to its movement.
6. If the Saar player announces a retreat during a space combat, but all their ships are destroyed that round, any Floating Factories in that system are destroyed without retreating.
7. If neither player has ships in the active system after the final round of combat, the Floating Factory is not destroyed, and does not retreat.
8. If the Saar player has their last ship destroyed during combat by aDirect Hitaction card, a Floating Factory in the system will be blockaded and destroyed, even if the Saar player produced enough hits to destroy their opponent’s remaining ships during that round of combat.
9. Players alternate using theSustain Damageability of their units, one at a time, starting with the active player, and continuing until both players decline, in a row, to use theSustain Damageof one of their units. If both the Saar player and their opponent have aDirect Hit, then the first unit to useSustain Damagewill be the first unit that may be destroyed by aDirect Hit. If the Saar player’s unit is the last to be destroyed, and leaves no other ships in the system, then a Floating Factory in that system will not be blockaded nor destroyed.
10. If, at the end of the combat, the Saar player has no ships, an their opponent has only fighters, then any Floating Factories in the system will be blockaded, and thus destroyed, before the fighters are removed due to lack of capacity.
11. If the Nekro player has only ground forces participating in the combat as ships due to the effect of their flagship, the Alastor, those ground forces will blockade and destroy any Floating Factories, even if those ground forces are on planets instead of in the space area.
12. When resolving an ability of theConstructionstrategy card, the Saar player must control a planet in the system they place a Floating Factory in.
13. The Saar player cannot place a Floating Factory in a system if the only planet they control in that system has theDemilitarized Zonecultural exploration card attached.
14. If an effect allows a Floating Factory to move through a system that contains another player’s ships (such as theLight/Wave Deflectorstechnology), it will not be blockaded in systems it moves through.
15. If a Floating Factory is in a system that contains none of the Saar player’s ships, and another player moves ships into that system, the Floating Factory is immediately destroyed.
16. This will happen before theSpace Cannon Offensestep. The Floating Factory is destroyed, even if all of the other player’ ships are destroyed during this step. Additionally, the Saar player cannot use that Floating Factory to resolve a space cannon roll enabled by theExperimental Battlestationaction card.
17. If all of the other player’s ships are removed due to a gravity rift, they will not arrive in the active system. The Floating Factory will not be destroyed.
18. A Floating Factory cannot count towards theImprove InfrastructureorProtect the Borderobjectives.
