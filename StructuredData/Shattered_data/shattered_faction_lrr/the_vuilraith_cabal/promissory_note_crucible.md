1. Each gravity rift will still provide its usual +1 to each ship’s move value.
2. Cruciblewill provide an additional +1 to each ship’s move value, which will not increase if that ship moves through two or more gravity rifts.
3. A ship that moves through or out of no gravity rifts will apply +0 to its move value.
4. A ship that moves through or out of one gravity rift will apply +2 to its move value.
5. A ship that moves through or out of two gravity rifts will apply +3 to its move value.
6. A ship that moves through or out of three gravity rifts will apply +4 to its move value.
7. And so on.
8. If a ship could move from its current system to the active system through a gravity rift if its move value were +2, it may do so usingCrucible. This is true even if that ship could not reach the gravity rift withoutCrucible.
9. For example, consider a series of systems X–S–G–Y. Only systems connected by a “–” are adjacent. System “G” is a gravity rift. Systems “X”, “S” and “Y” are standard systems with no movement restrictions. A ship with a move value of one is in system “X”. Were it to have +2 to its movement value, it could reach system “Y”. Currently, that ship may reach only system “S”. Despite this, if its owner activated system “Y” and playedCrucible, the ship could move to that system.
10. If the active player receivedCrucibleon a previous turn, they may play it and immediately perform a transaction with the Vuil’raith player to regain it. However,Cruciblecannot be played twice in one timing window. The active player cannot playCrucibleagain until their next turn.
11. Any deal between the Vuil’raith player and another player regarding whenCruciblewill be played, if made beforeCrucibleis exchanged, is non–binding.
12. If a player plays bothCrucibleand theNav Suiteaction card during the same tactical action, they will still apply +1 to the move value of their ships that move through or out of a gravity rift.
