# LRR CLARIFICATION: The Vuil’raith Cabal
## TYPE: Unit
### COMPONENT: Dimensional Tear
#### ID: the_vuilraith_cabal_dimensional_tear

1. This system is a gravity rift, and thus an anomaly.
2. This system qualifies for theMake Historyand similar such objectives.
3. If a ship moves through or out of multiple gravity rifts, and/or the same gravity rift multiple times, each instance will provide a +1 to movement.
4. For example, consider a series of systems A–B–C–M. Only systems connected by a “–” are adjacent. Systems “A”, “B” and “C” have dimensional tears, while system “M” does not. The Vuil’raith player has a carrier with move one in system “C” and a ground force in system “A”. They could activate system “M” and move the carrier along the path “C” → “B” → “A” → “B” → “C” → “M”, picking up the ground force from system “A”. This path would make the carriers move value 1+5, which is more than enough for this movement.
5. Multiple Dimensional Tears in a single system have no additional effects.
6. If a Dimensional Tear is in a system that is normally a gravity rift (e.g. the Cormund system), the Vuil’raith player will not have to roll for removal when moving out of or through that system. There are no additional effects.
7. If a Dimensional Tear is in a system with a Nebula, then the +1 to move values will be applied after the nebula sets each ship’s move value to 1.
8. If the Dimensional Tear plastic figure is destroyed or removed, the Dimensional Tear token is also removed.
