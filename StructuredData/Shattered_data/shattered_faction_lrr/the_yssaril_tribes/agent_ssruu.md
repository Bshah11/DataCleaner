# LRR CLARIFICATION: The Yssaril Tribes
## TYPE: Agent
### COMPONENT: Ssruu
#### ID: the_yssaril_tribes_ssruu

1. If the Yssaril player duplicates an agent that allows a unit to roll an additional die, and both the duplicated agent and Ssruu target the same unit, that unit will roll two additional dice.
2. If the Yssaril player duplicates the Saar player’s Captain Mendosa agent, they may do so before or after other effects are used to modify any ship’s move value. This includes the Saar player’s Captain Mendosa agent effect.
3. If both the Yssaril player and the Vuil’raith player wish to target the same player with the Vuil’raith The Stillness of Stars agent ability, then they will both be able to capture a ship, resolving in initiative order from the active player. Both players will still use the target player’s full commodity value to determine which units they may capture. Should the first player to resolve capture the last of a type of unit from the target player’s reinforcements, the latter player cannot capture a unit of the same type.
4. If the Yssaril player duplicates the Mentak player’s Suffi An agent, then the Yssaril player and the player targeted by the Mentak player’sPillageability will draw action cards. The Mentak player will not.
5. Duplicating the effect of the Argent player’s Trillossa Aun Mirik agent, the Creuss player’s Emissary Taivra agent or the Jol–Nar player’s Doctor Sucaban agent during the same timing window as that agent is used will have no additional effect.
6. If either the Yssaril player or the Nomad player resolve the effect of the Nomad player’s The Thundarian agent, the other will be unable to resolve the same effect immediately. They must wait until dice are rolled again before they may resolve the effect.
