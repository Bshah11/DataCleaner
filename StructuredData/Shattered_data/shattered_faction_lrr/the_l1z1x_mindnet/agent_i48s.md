1. The infantry must be in the system when it is activated for it to be eligible to be replaced. It cannot be replaced if it is moved into or produced in the active system later in the turn.
2. If a player wishes to place a mech, but there are none left in their reinforcements, they may remove a mech from any system that does not contain one of their command tokens and place that instead. The mech will be placed undamaged.
