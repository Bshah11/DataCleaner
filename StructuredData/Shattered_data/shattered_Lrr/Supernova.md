# Supernova
## Specific rule - [A supernova is an anomaly that affects movement.]
### Rule points
1. A ship cannot move through or into a supernova.

### Notes
- If a ship finds itself in a supernova by some uncommon game effect, it may remain there and move out without harm.
- A future rule change will place the ship movement restrictions of anomalies upon all units.
