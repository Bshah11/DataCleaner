# Transactions
## Specific rule - [A transaction is a way for a player to exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments.]
### Rule points
1. During the active player’s turn, they may resolve up to one transaction with each of their neighbors.

    1. A player can resolve a transaction at any time during their turn, even during a combat.
2. To resolve a transaction, a player gives any number of trade goods and commodities and up to one promissory note to a neighbor in exchange for any number of trade goods, commodities, and relic fragments, and up to one promissory note.
3. Players can exchange commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, and relic fragments, but cannot exchange other types of cards or tokens.

    1. The Emirates of Hacan can also exchange action cards with other players as part of their transactions.
4. A transaction does not have to be even. A player may exchange components of unequal value or give components without receiving something in return.

    1. The players agree on the terms of the transaction before exchanging any components. After the components are traded, the transaction cannot be undone.
5. Players can resolve a transaction as part of a deal.
6. While resolving each agenda during the agenda phase, a player may perform one transaction with each other player.

    1. Players do not need to be neighbors to perform these transactions.

### Notes
- Relic fragments may be traded. Relics themselves cannot be.
- Captured units may be returned to the player that originally owned them as part of a transaction.
- If a player becomes neighbors with another player on their turn, they may then perform a transaction with that player.

    - If a player stops being neighbors with another player that they have performed a transaction with this turn, but then become neighbors with that player again later that same turn, they cannot perform a second transaction with that player.
    - A player may perform a transaction during combat with their opponent, even if they are neighbors only in the active system.
- If a player may perform multiple actions on their turn, they may still only resolve one transaction with each of their neighbors.
- If an agenda is discarded and replaced with another, players who resolved a transaction during the discarded agenda may resolve another transaction during the replacement agenda.
