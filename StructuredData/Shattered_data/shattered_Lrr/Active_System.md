# Active System
## Specific rule - [The active system is the system that is activated during a tactical action.]
### Rule points
1. When a player performs a tactical action, they activate a system by placing a command token from their tactic pool in that system. That system is the active system.
2. A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of their command tokens.
3. A player can activate a system that contains command tokens that match other players’ factions.
4. A system remains the active system for the duration of the tactical action during which it was activated.

### Notes
- A player may only move into a nebula if it is the active system.
- No system is the active system during a component or strategic action.

    - Effects that trigger when a system is activated will not trigger during a component or strategic action.
- After activating a system during a tactical action, play will proceed to the Movement step.
