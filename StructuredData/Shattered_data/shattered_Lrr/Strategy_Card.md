# Strategy Card
## Specific rule - [Strategy cards determine initiative order and provide each player with a powerful ability that they can use one time during the action phase.]
### Rule points
1. During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card from the common play area and places it in their play area faceup.
2. Each strategy card has a readied and an exhausted side.

    1. The readied side contains the strategy card’s name, initiative number, and abilities.
    2. The exhausted side contains the strategy card’s initiative number.
3. A player can only resolve the primary ability of their own strategy cards.
4. A player can only resolve the secondary ability of strategy cards that were chosen by other players .
5. There are eight strategy cards, each of which has a name and an initiative number.
6. The initiative number on a player’s strategy card determines the initiative order for the action phase and status phase.
7. A strategy card has both a primary ability and a secondary ability. These abilities are resolved during a strategic action.
8. Each strategy card exists in either the common play area or a player’s play area.

    1. Strategy cards in the common play area are available for players to choose during the strategy phase.
    2. A strategy card in a player’s play area belongs to that player until it is returned to the common play area during the status phase.

### Notes
- During three– and four–player games, each player will choose two strategy cards during the strategy phase.

    - Players will use the lower of the two initiative numbers on their strategy cards to determine the initiative order.
