# AUTHORITY 1: General Rule
## CATEGORY: Ability Definitions
### SOURCE: Living Rules Reference (tirules.com)

## Specific rule - [Cards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve to trigger various game effects.]
### Rule points
1. If information in this Rules Reference contradicts the Learn to Play booklet, the Rules Reference takes precedence.
2. If a card ability contradicts information in the Rules Reference, the card takes precedence. If both the card and the rules can be followed at the same time, they should be.
3. Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.

  1. If an ability with a specified duration is resolved, the effect of the ability remains through that duration, even if the component that caused the ability is removed.
4. If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its own paragraph.
5. If an ability contains the word “Action” a player must use a component action during the action phase to resolve that ability.
6. If an ability uses the word “cannot”, that effect is absolute.

  1. If two abilities use the word “cannot”, a persistent ability takes precedence over a one–time ability and an enabling ability takes precedence over a cancel ability.
7. When a player resolves an ability, they must resolve the ability in its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word “may” are optional, and the player resolving the ability may choose not to resolve those parts.
8. Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory unless those abilities use the word “may”.
9. If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word “and”, a player must resolve as many of the ability’s effects as possible. However, if the player cannot resolve all of its effects, that player is allowed to resolve as many as they can.
