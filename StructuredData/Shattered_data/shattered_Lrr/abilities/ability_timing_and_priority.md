#### Timing
12. If the timing of an ability uses the word “before” or “after”, the ability’s effect occurs immediately before or after the described timing event, respectively.

  1. For example, if an ability is resolved “after a ship is destroyed”, the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship is destroyed and not later during that turn or round.
13. If the timing of an ability uses the word “when”, the ability’s effect occurs at the moment of the described timing event.

  1. Such an ability typically modifies or replaces the timing event in some way.
14. Effects that occur “when” an event happens take priority over effects that occur “after” an event happens.
15. If an ability uses the word “then”, a player must resolve the effect that occurs before the word “then” or they cannot resolve the effect that occurs after the word “then”.
16. Each ability can be resolved once for each occurrence of that ability’s timing event. For example, if an ability is resolved “at the start of combat”, it can be resolved at the start of each combat.
17. If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the action phase , each player takes a turn resolving an ability in initiative order, beginning with the active player. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.
18. If there are multiple abilities that players wish to resolve at the same time during the strategy or agenda phases , players take turns resolving abilities starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise. This process continues until each player has resolved each ability that they wish to resolve during that window.
