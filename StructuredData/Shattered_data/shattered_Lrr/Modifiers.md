# Modifiers
## Specific rule - [A modifier is a number that is applied by an ability to increase or decrease the attribute values of a unit or the results of a die roll.]
### Rule points
1. A modifier is always preceded by the word “apply” followed by a numerical value.
2. A modifier value preceded by a “+” is added to the attribute or result being modified; a modifier value preceded by a “−” is subtracted from the attribute or result being modified.

### Notes
- “Combat roll” modifiers do not modify anti–fighter barrage, bombardment or space cannon rolls.
- When an effect moves a unit to an adjacent system, modifying that unit’s move value will have no effect.
