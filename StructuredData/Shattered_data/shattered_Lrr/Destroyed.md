# Destroyed
## Specific rule - [Various game effects can cause a unit to be destroyed. When a player’s unit is destroyed, it is removed from the game board and returned to their reinforcements.]
### Rule points
1. When a player assigns hits that were produced against their units, that player chooses a number of their units to be destroyed equal to the number of hits produced against those units.
2. If a player’s unit is removed from the board by a game effect, it is not treated as being destroyed; effects that trigger when a unit is destroyed are not triggered.
