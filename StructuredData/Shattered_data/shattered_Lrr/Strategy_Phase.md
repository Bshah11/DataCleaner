# Strategy Phase
## Specific rule - [During the strategy phase, each player chooses a strategy card to use during the round.]
### Rule points
1. Step 1 : Starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses one strategy card from the common play area and places it faceup in their play area.

    1. If there are one or more trade good tokens on a strategy card when a player chooses it, that player gains those trade goods.
    2. A player cannot choose a strategy card that another player has already chosen during the current strategy phase.
    3. When playing with three or four players, each player will choose a second strategy card. After the last player has received their first strategy card, each player chooses a second strategy card, starting with the speaker and proceeding clockwise.
2. Step 2 : The speaker places one trade good token from the supply on each strategy card that was not chosen.

    1. During a four– or eight–player game, all strategy cards will be chosen, and therefore no trade good tokens will be placed on strategy cards.

> Then, players proceed to the action phase.


### Notes
- If a player chooses a strategy card, but later loses it, they will keep any trade goods that were on the strategy card.
