# Reinforcements
## Specific rule - [A player’s reinforcements is that player’s personal supply of units and command tokens that are not on the game board or otherwise in use.]
### Rule points
1. The components in a player’s reinforcements are limited.

### Notes

- Command tokens on a player’s command sheet are not in that player’s reinforcements.
- Captured units are not in any player’s reinforcements.
