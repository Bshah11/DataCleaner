# Component Action
## Specific rule - [A component action is a type of action that a player can perform during their turn of an action phase.]
### Rule points
1. Component actions can be found on various game components, including action cards, technology cards, leaders, exploration cards, relics, promissory notes, and faction sheets. Each component action is indicated by an “Action” header.
2. To perform a component action, a player reads the action’s text and follows the instructions as described.
3. A component action cannot be performed if its ability cannot be completely resolved.
4. If a component action is canceled, it does not use that player’s action.

### Notes
- Action cards without the “Action” header are not used to perform component actions.
