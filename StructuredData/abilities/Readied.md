# Readied
## Specific rule - [Cards have a readied state, which indicates that a player can exhaust or resolve the abilities on those cards.]
### Rule points
1. A card that is readied is placed faceup in a player’s play area; a card that is exhausted is placed facedown in a player’s area.
2. A player can exhaust a readied planet card to spend resources or influence from that card’s planet.
3. A player can exhaust certain readied technology cards to resolve those cards’ abilities.

    1. Such a technology will specifically instruct a player to exhaust the card as part of the ability’s cost.
4. If a card is exhausted, a player cannot resolve that card’s abilities or spend resources or influence on that card until it is readied.
5. During a Ready Cards step, each player readies all of their exhausted cards by flipping them faceup.
6. When a player performs a strategic action, they exhaust their chosen strategy card.

    1. That card is later readied during the status phase.

### Notes
- Passive abilities on an exhausted card are still in effect while that card is exhausted.
- Planets will also ready at the end of each agenda phase. Leaders, relics and technologies will not.
- If a game effect instructs a player to ready a planet, the readied planet must be controlled by that player, unless the game effect specifies otherwise.
