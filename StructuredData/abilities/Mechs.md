# Mechs
## Specific rule - [Mechs are unique, faction–specific heavy ground forces.]
### Rule points
1. Mechs are a type of ground force and can be transported and participate in ground combat.
2. Each player begins with their mech unit card in play on their leader sheet and can produce mechs for the cost presented on the card.
3. Some mechs have Deploy abilities which allow a player to place them on the game board without producing them normally.
4. Mech unit cards are not technologies.

### Notes
- Effects that refer to “ground forces” apply to mechs. Effects that refer to “infantry” do not.
- For notes about a mech of a specific faction, see that faction’s page.
