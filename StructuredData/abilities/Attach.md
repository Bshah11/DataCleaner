# Attach
## Specific rule - [Some game effects instruct a player to attach a card to a planet card. The attached card modifies that planet card in some way.]
### Rule points
1. To attach a card to a planet card, a player places the card with the attach effect partially underneath the planet card.
2. If a player gains or loses control of planet that contains a card with an attach effect, the attached card stays with that planet.

    1. The attached card maintains its exhausted or readied state.
    2. If a planet card is purged, also purge all cards that are attached to that planet card and remove the corresponding attachment tokens from the game board.
3. When a card is attached to a planet card, place the corresponding attachment token on that planet on the game board.

### Notes
- There is no limit on how many attachments a single planet may have.
- The Custodians Token is not an attachment.
