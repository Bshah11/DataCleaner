# Action Phase
## Specific rule - [During the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. During a player’s turn, they perform a single action. After each player has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. This process continues until all players have passed.]
### Rule points
1. During a player’s turn, they may perform one of the following three types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a component action.
2. If a player cannot perform an action, they must pass.
3. After a player has passed, they have no further turns and cannot perform additional actions during that action phase.

    1. During a turn that a player passes, they can resolve transactions and “at the start of your turn” abilities.
    2. A player that has passed can still resolve the secondary ability of other players’ strategy cards.
    3. It is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive actions during an action phase if all other players have passed during that action phase.
4. A player cannot pass until they have performed the strategic action of their strategy card.

    1. During a three–player or four–player game, a player cannot pass until they have exhausted both of their strategy cards.
5. After all players have passed, play proceeds to the status phase.

### Notes
- Players may still play non–component action action cards after they have passed.
- Any abilities that occur at the end of an action happen before any abilities that occur at the end of a player’s turn.
- A player may resolve “at the start of your turn” and “at the end of your turn” abilities on the turn that they pass.
- If all other players have passed, a player will continue to resolve “at the start of your turn” and “at the end of your turn” abilities.
