### Slipstream
During your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system that contains either an alpha or beta wormhole.

### Creuss Gate
When you create the game board, place the Creuss Gate (tile 17) where your home system would normally be placed. The Creuss Gate system is not a home system. Then place your home system (tile 51) in your play area.
